    "description": "Equipped with 32-bit microcomputer, RX family flagship RX72N is an excellent choice for GUI creation using LCD, HMI development such as voice input/output, and IoT device development using Wi-Fi, BLE or Ethernet. By using LVGL's demo repository with Renesas' ecosystem, you can experience immediately and develop quickly. The IC is equipped with the third-generation RX CPU core, the RXv3, and an internal networking of peripheral allowing real-time control high-performance with a single chip. The device also has complete security capability, vital for industrial and consumer equipment today.",
